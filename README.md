# Overview
This was just a simple afternoon project where I decided to re-purpose an existing Discord bot that I already had.

From time to time I wanted to share images and found that imgur urls were the easiest way to do it but it was a hassle to upload each time I needed it.

This bot solves that problem as I can paste the image into the Discord channel and it will upload to Imgur for me and provide the URL for future reference should I need it.
